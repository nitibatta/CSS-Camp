When using your variable as a CSS property value, 
you can attach a fallback value that your page will revert to if for some reason it can't get your variable to work.

It could be that someone is using an older browser that hasn't yet adopted CSS Variables, 
or perhaps their device doesn't support the value you gave the variable. Here's how you do it:

background: var(--penguin-skin, black);
This will set background to black if there is a problem with your variable.

Note that this can be useful for debugging.


Add a fallback value of black to the background property of penguin-top and penguin-bottom classes. 
This style will be applied because of a typo in the variable name.
