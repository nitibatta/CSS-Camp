After you create your variable, you can assign its value to other CSS properties by referencing the name you gave it.

background: var(--penguin-skin);
This will change the background of whatever element you are targeting to gray 
because that is the value of the --penguin-skin variable.

Note that styles will not be applied unless the variable names are an exact match.


Apply the --penguin-skin variable to the background property of the 
penguin-top, penguin-bottom, right-hand and left-hand classes.
