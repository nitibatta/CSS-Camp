What is a Media Query?
Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

Example:
If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}

CSS Variables can simplify the way you use media queries.

For instance, when your screen is smaller or larger than your media query break point, 
you can change the value of a variable, and it will apply its style wherever it is used.


In the :root selector of the media query, 
change it so --penguin-size is redefined and given a value of 200px. Also, redefine --penguin-skin and 
give it a value of black. Then resize the preview to see this change in action.
